"""
This server's job is to take a message from the client, expecting an encrypted
symmetric key. The symmetric key is encrypted using the server's public key.
When the encrypted key is received, it is decrypted using the asymmetrical
private key that the server has, and then sends it back to the client.

The resource the client is looking to process is encrypted with symmetrical
key encryption. The client has a copy of the key, however the key itself has
been encrypted with asymmetrical encryption - encrypted with the server's
public key, and thus can only be decrypted by the server's private key as a
result.
